## Instructions
Hello, welcome to Untitled Folder!
To use the website please download .zip or to the "Untitled-v_.__" folder. 
After, right click the .zip, and press extract all 
Then open Untitled.html (all other files are not meant to be touched and/or messed with!) 
Untitled Folder is a LFU site and was made by ItzKvrt

To use WebRetro, a standalone Retro ROM Emulator (source: https://github.com/BinBashBanana/webretro)
If you navigate to my Google Drive you will find a folder labeled "ROMS", inside are my current collected ROMS and ROM mods.
Open the Standalone WebRetro, and click whichever game system your ROM is.
Then upload your ROM file and play! ROMS can be found online easily.
